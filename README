This is a very basic syntax package for Cadence Design Systems `spectre` simulator files. These are enhanced SPICE decks and so somewhat esoteric.

Any comments are welcome. :)

### Installation

I really like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). As a vim newbie I found it easy to install with all the functions I needed.
